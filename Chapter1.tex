centuries and has attracted interest from some of the most brilliant
philosophers and scientists human kind has had to offer, such as

model the mind. Some used the connectionist model (CITE ROSENBLATT,
PERCEPTRON, etc.), where as another set of researchers worked with
manipulation of symbols (mention physical symbol systems here).

But even by the 1970s psychology was not able to offer a unified
theory of cognition(Site Unified theories of cognition here). Newell
pushed for providing a framework by which various cognitive
psychological phenomena could be explained in a unified way. This lead
to the creation of cognitive architectures. Cognitive architectures

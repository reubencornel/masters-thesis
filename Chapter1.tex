%Things to talk about here

% Introduce cognitive modelling
The study of the human mind has been one of the largest and most
laborious enterprises undertaken by man. This study has encompassed many
centuries and has attracted interest from some of the most brilliant
philosophers and scientists human kind has had to offer, such as
Aristotle, Plato, Descartes and more recently Allen Newell, Marvin
Minksy. 

%% Introduce computer science into the picture
%%  Introduce the various ways by which we have tried to under stand
With the advent of computers researchers attempted to use the superior
processing power of the computers to simulate the working of the
mind. Some reseachers attempted to use a purely connectionist model to
represent the working of the human mind(CITE ROSENBLATT). Where as
others, such as Newell and Anderson attempted to use the manipulations of symbols
to represent the same.

% Introduce the need for architectures
Despite large advances made towards understanding the principles of
the human mind in the field of psychology, there was little to show
except for micro theories, such as Fitts law and the Power law of
practice, etc. As Newell suggests in his book (cite unified theories
of cognition) that these theories fail to provide a complete
representation of 

It was during this period that Newell advocated for
architectures that would help represent the

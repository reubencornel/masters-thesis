Cognitive scientists who build computational models of their work, as
exemplified by the ACT-R and Soar research communities, have limited
means of sharing knowledge: annual conferences and workshops, summer
schools, and model code distributed via Web sites. The consequence is
that results obtained by different groups are scattered across the
Internet, making it difficult for researchers to obtain a
comprehensive view of cognitive modeling research. The goal of my
project is to develop a collaborative modeling environment for
cognitive scientists in which they can develop and share models. The
current system supports collaboration by providing a structured
representation for ACT-R cognitive models using frames. The rationale
for providing a structured representation for cognitive models is
two-fold: it not only provides a mechanism for sharing models (i.e.
via consistent APIs); it also enables the application of
analytical techniques to cognitive models. As a proof of concept for
the approach, a medium-scale modeling application has been developed,
integrating an extension of ACT-R developed elsewhere, to solve
synonym crossword puzzles.

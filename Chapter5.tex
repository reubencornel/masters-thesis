\chapter{Design and Implementation}
\label{chap-five}


% Introduction

% Discuss what this chapter will focus on and dive in.
The purpose of this chapter is three fold: it discusses the motivations
that governed the design of the system, such as using the
BioBike\cite{journals/bioinformatics/MassarTES05} chassis and using
frames as a data structure to represent ACT-R based cognitive models;
it describes the work flow of the system that enables users to build
and share models and finally it discusses in detail a medium scale
model that was built as a proof of concept.

% Design Decisions
%       - Why biobike

\section{Work Flow}
% Coglaborate
%       - Describe work flow that shows collaboration occurs with screen shots.
%       - Describe what was modified and why
%         - Describe how frames are created
%         - Describe how the reverse procedure is implemented

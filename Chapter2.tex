\chapter{Cognitive Architectures}
\label{chap-two}

The quest to understand the working of the human mind has spanned
many centuries starting with Plato when he asked, as in the words of
Noam Chomsky citing Bertrand Russell, "How comes is that human beings
whose contacts of the world are brief, personal and limited, are
nevertheless able to know as much as they do." (Cite history of
cognitive science by Radu J Bogdan). 

Cognitive science brings together the varied disciplines of
psychology, neuroscience, computer science and philosophy in an
attempt to appreciate the mechanisms of the mind.
It aims to understand the structures and the mechanisms
used to store knowledge and the methods of the processes that work on
them

The objective of this chapter is <fill in blank>fold; firstly it aims
to provide an introduction to the view that cognitive science takes of
human cognition from both the classical perspective and the
connectionist view.

\chapter{A survey of Cognitive Architectures}
\label{The_nature_of_cognition}

The quest to understand the working of the human mind has spanned
many centuries starting with Plato when he asked, as in the words of
Noam Chomsky citing Bertrand Russell, ``How comes is that human beings
whose contacts of the world are brief, personal and limited, are
nevertheless able to know as much as they do.'' \cite{Bogdan:1993aa}

Cognitive science brings together the varied disciplines of
psychology, neuroscience, computer science, linguistics and philosophy in an
attempt to answer the above question, using information processes as a
means to emulate the algorithms and processes of the human
mind. Psychology, especially cognitive psychology contributes theories
on cognitive capacities, information processing capabilities and
perhaps most importantly it tries to provide hypothesis that theorize
about the overall picture of the human mind. Neuroscience, the study
of the nervous system,  provides a frame of reference against which
theories developed in cognitive science can be validated since it
deals with the brain at the lowest level. Secondly, it provides  knowledge
for developing an alternative architecture of the mind. Computer
Science contributes to the enterprise knowledge representation which is
used to develop theories to represent the way knowledge is stored;
artificial intelligence which is used to analyse and create methods
for problem solving; the theory of computation which is used as a
means to develop representations for cognitive
architectures.

The objective of this chapter is three-fold; firstly it aims
to provide a very brief introduction to the human cognitive
architecture from both the cognitivist and
emergent\cite{DBLP:journals/tec/VernonMS07} perspective. Secondly
it discusses cognitive architecture in general and finally goes on
to compare some currently widely used cognitive architectures.

\section{The nature of cognition}
\label{nature_Of_Cognition}
Any attempt to deal with the architecture of cognition has to answer
the following questions.

\begin{itemize}
\item What is knowledge and how can it be categorized?
\item How is knowledge acquired and represented?
\item How do various processes act on this knowledge and how do they
achieve the effect they intend to achieve?
\item How can these processes and structures be manifested in the real
world?
\end{itemize}



 When solving problems the human mind has the ability to
retrieve and apply previously stored knowledge to the problem; for
example consider solving a calculus based integration problem, we are
able to retrieve standard representations of the forms of equations
and apply it to the problem to simplify it and solve it. Hence this
question is one of the questions that is central to understanding
cognition.

This question is significant because its answer explains the
techniques of deduction and inference we use to solve problems on an
everyday basis; this could be as simple and routine as diagnosing a
light bulb is not working and replace it, or perhaps the techniques we
use when solving a crossword puzzle. 

This is summarized best by Bogdan \cite{Bogdan:1993aa}

\begin{quote}
It takes a real system, made of physical bits and pieces, to 
instantiate cognitive structures and processes and run the program of 
cognition.
\end{quote}

These questions provide us with a very general framework of the
results to be provided by cognitive science. Newell in his book
\emph{The Unified Theories of Cognition} and in
\cite{Newell1980135} describes the study of the working of the mind as
a problem of satisfying the ``Conjunction of constraints on the nature
of mind like systems.'' He describes the characteristics of what is to
be expected of any theory that claims to propose a model of human
cognition. Newell mentions that this list is not comprehensive, but in
the view of Anderson \& Lebiere it can used to provide a broad
framework against which all theories that claim to explain the human
mind can be tested.
 

These criteria have been listed below, have been referenced from
\cite{CambridgeJournals:207162} and \cite{Newell:1990aa}. The purpose
of listing these criteria below is to explain as to what the study of
the mind would require.

\begin{itemize}
\item Behave flexibly as a function of the environment: At first
glance this statement describes that the nature of human cognition
is <CHOOSE A RIGHT WORD>. Newell did make it clear that he was referring
to the view that a cognitive system can be viewed as an instance of a
universal computer, specifically a turing machine, despite its occasional
failings and lack of infinite memory. He further explains that this
view does not indicate the inablity to perform special operations, for
example, vision. He explains that like computers with special
processing units the cognitive system can be made up of special
purpose systems that specialize in a certain task. As an example
consider the example of chemist they are able to perform congnitive
tasks that are relates to their field and they are also able to drive
their car. This 


\item Operate in real time: A system that models cognition should be
able to explain the reason as to how we are able to perform cognitive
tasks at the speed humans do. This criteria is important because if a
system is not able to explain it could lead us to wrong assumptions
about how humans think.


\item Exhibit rational adapative behaviour: It must be able to explain
this because humans perform computations and those computations, as in the words of
Newell\cite{Newell:1990aa}, are for ``the service of goals and
rationally related to obtaining things that let the organism survive
and propagate.''

\item Display dynamic behaviour: Humans operate in an
environment that is ever changing. They draw in this
information from their environment and act on it appropriately. For
example, if you are driving your car and at that moment a deer decides
to sprint in front of your car, you would hit the brakes. 

\item Integrate diverse knowledge: Humans acquire knowledge from
diverse sources and are able to integrate them. For example consider a
computer programmer working the in the banking industry. He can go to
school to obtain knowledge of the working of the finance industry. He
can use this knowledge along with his knowledge of computers science
to write programs for the industry. Here we see that our fictitious
programmer integrating knowledge, unlike expert systems where
knowledge is vertical and cannot be integrated as easily.

\item Exhibits a sense of consciousness: Newell could not
point out to the direct relation between consciousness and human
cognition but he did mention it as one of the criteria in his tests of
human cognition. An interpretation of this as taken from
\cite{CambridgeJournals:207162} is that Newell was asking us to pick
out criteria for this test and the authors of that paper point towards
using sections from a volume titled ``Scientific approaches to
Consciousness".

\item Learning from the environment: This point should be self
evident, we gain new knowledge from the world around us. But then
the type of learning itself should be based on whether it can learn based on
semantic memory, skill, priming and conditioning.

\item Arise through evolution: It is understood that the algorithms we
use today are those that have arisen naturally over a period of time,
hence any cognitive architecture should be able to learn and improve
the algorithms that it has been given (?)

\item Use of Natural language: Any theory that claims to decipher human
cognition must be able to explain as to how we are able to comprehend
what we listen, understand what we speak because this is a function
that is core to the way we communicate with each other.

\item Be realizable with in the brain: This point is critical because
it serves as proof that a given theory is congruous with actual
computations in the brain.
\end{itemize}
\section{Approaches towards explaining cognition}
    There are many theories on the nature of cognition each of them
    taking a position on what constitutes cognitive functions and how
    they are carried out. But these approches can be bifurcated into
    approaches that adhere to the \emph{cognitivist
    approach}\cite{DBLP:journals/tec/VernonMS07}, these are theories
    that view cognition as information processes manipulating symbols
    and those that stick to the \emph{emergent approach}, that believe
    that treat cogntion as 'symbolic, rational, encapsulated,
    structured and algorithmic'[CITE REFERENCE].
    
    The goal of objective of this section is to explore these points
    of view and conclude by bringing out differences between these
    disparate points of view, after which we examine a number of
    cognitive architectures in detail.
\subsection{The Cognitivist view}
     
     The cognitivist perspective views human cognition as a set of
     information processes working over a set of representations that
     point to the actual knowledge which may be stored else where,
     vis-\'{a}-vis symbols. These information processes are said to be
     purposeful, contentful, representational and can be described
     formally\cite{103009}. Knowledge derived from these computations
     can be stored and used later to improve the reasoning of the
     system. The cognitivist views the function of perception is to
     generate an appropriate representation of the the world around
     the system which the system uses to reason
     \cite{DBLP:journals/tec/VernonMS07}.

     The task of building models in cognitivist system is generally
     done by a programmer. Which is good in a way that these
     representations and structures can be viewed and interpreted by
     humans. But it may also ``bias the system'' and constrain it to an
     idealized cognitive environment. As a result this cause
     problems when the system does have to stray away from this
     requirements, this gap between perception, which is in
     interpretation of reality, and actual reality begin to
     widen. This would then have to be filled in with more programmer
     knowledge to close this ``semantic
     gap''\cite{DBLP:journals/tec/VernonMS07}. 
     
\subsection{The Connectionist approach}


     Until the 1980s the cognitivist viewpoint was the primary means
     of explaining the nature of human cognition. Interest in
     self-organizing systems led to an area of research that advocated
     the view that human cognition is made up of smaller units that
     rearrange themselves as the system acquires a skill or recognizes
     a change in its environment. This approach to understanding is
     known as the \emph{emergent approach}\cite{DBLP:journals/tec/VernonMS07}.
     
     Although there are multiple methods are used to in the area of
     emergent systems, I will describe only the emergent systems from
     the connectionist view point. The basic feature in a
     connectionist system is a connectionist network. A connectionist
     network is made up of a number of simple computational units that
     communicate with each other with via connections. These
     connections are capable of carrying only simple
     information.

     
     The computational units are arranged in a number of hierarchial
     layers. These networks can be arranged into two basic configurations
     namely \emph{feed forward} networks and \emph{recurrent}
     networks. 

     Feed forward networks(Fig \ref{ASCA_AFFN} are those networks in
     which information flows in one direction only, that is from the
     input nodes to the hidden nodes(if they exist) and then to the output nodes.
